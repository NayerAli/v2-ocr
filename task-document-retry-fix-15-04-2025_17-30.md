# Document Retry Fix - 15-04-2025 17:30

## Issue Description
The retry button in the document list and document details dialog was not working correctly. When clicked, it would refresh the entire page, which is unnecessary and disruptive to the user experience. Additionally, the retry functionality was not properly updating the document status in the UI.

## Root Causes
1. The retry button was directly calling the API endpoint without updating the local state
2. The page was being refreshed unnecessarily after retrying a document
3. The retry functionality was implemented directly in the UI components instead of being passed as a prop

## Implemented Fixes

### 1. Created Proper Retry Handlers
- Added `handleRetry` functions in both the documents page and dashboard page
- Implemented proper error handling and user feedback via toast notifications
- Ensured the local state is updated after a successful retry

### 2. Eliminated Page Refreshes
- Removed all `window.location.reload()` calls from retry functions
- Updated the UI state directly after API calls to reflect the new document status
- Ensured a smooth user experience without page refreshes

### 3. Improved Component Architecture
- Updated the `DocumentList` component to accept an `onRetry` prop
- Updated the `DocumentDetailsDialog` component to accept an `onRetry` prop
- Ensured all components use the same retry handler for consistency

## Files Modified
1. `app/components/document-list.tsx` - Updated to accept and use the onRetry prop
2. `app/components/document-details-dialog.tsx` - Updated to accept and use the onRetry prop
3. `app/documents/page.tsx` - Added handleRetry function and passed it to components
4. `app/page.tsx` - Added handleRetry function and passed it to components

## Testing
The changes have been tested to ensure:
1. The retry button works correctly in both the document list and document details dialog
2. The document status is updated in the UI without refreshing the page
3. Proper error handling and user feedback is provided

## Next Steps
1. Monitor the application to ensure the fix resolves the issue with document retrying
2. Consider adding more detailed error information for failed retries
3. Add more comprehensive logging for document status changes
