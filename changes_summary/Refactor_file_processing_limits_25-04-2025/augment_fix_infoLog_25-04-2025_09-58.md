# Fix for infoLog Reference Error - 25-05-24

## Issue Description

The application was experiencing a reference error when processing PDF files:

```
ReferenceError: Cannot access 'infoLog' before initialization
    at FileProcessor.processPage (file-processor.ts:362:7)
```

This error occurred because the `infoLog` function was being used before its import was fully initialized. The issue was in the `processPage` method of the `FileProcessor` class.

## Changes Made

1. **Fixed the `processPage` method in `lib/ocr/file-processor.ts`**:
   - Moved the import of `infoLog` to the very beginning of the method to ensure it's fully initialized before use
   - Simplified the code by using a single import of `infoLog` throughout the method instead of multiple imports
   - Removed redundant imports of `infoLog` in nested try/catch blocks

2. **Fixed the `hasValidOCRProvider` call in `processFile` method**:
   - Added `await` to the `hasValidOCRProvider()` call since it's an async method
   - Replaced `console.error` with `infoLog` for consistent logging

## Benefits

1. **Resolved Reference Error**: Fixed the "Cannot access 'infoLog' before initialization" error
2. **Improved Code Consistency**: Used a single logging approach throughout the file
3. **Better Async Handling**: Properly awaited the async `hasValidOCRProvider` method

## Testing Notes

The changes should be tested with:
1. Small PDFs (1-5 pages)
2. Medium PDFs (10-20 pages)
3. Large PDFs (50+ pages)
4. Image files

Verify that:
- PDF processing completes without reference errors
- Progress updates correctly during processing
- Results are saved properly for each page
- Error handling works as expected
