# Error Document Display Fix - 20-05-2024 18:00

## Issue Description
When a file was uploaded but failed to process due to an invalid API key, it was not being displayed in the document list or dashboard. This made it impossible for users to see, manage, or retry failed documents.

## Root Causes
1. The queue manager was correctly marking documents with error status in the database, but there was an issue with how the error was being handled in the queue map
2. The stats calculation in the dashboard was not including documents with error status
3. The processing status card was not showing error documents

## Implemented Fixes

## Testing
