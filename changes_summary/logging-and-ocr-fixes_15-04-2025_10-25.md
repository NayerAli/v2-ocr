# Logging and OCR Fixes

## 1. Reducing Browser Console Logs

### Issues
- Browser console was being spammed with debug logs
- Logs were being printed on every render, even when not needed
- Settings initialization logs were particularly verbose

### Fixes
- Added conditional logging based on development environment
- Reduced frequency of logs using random sampling
- Only log on initial load or significant state changes
- Added proper conditions to prevent excessive logging

### Implementation Details
- Updated `use-settings-init.ts` to only log in development mode
- Added random sampling to reduce log frequency
- Updated `page.tsx` to only log on initial load or in development mode
- Improved log messages to be more informative and less frequent

## 2. Adding Timestamps to Server Console Logs

### Issues
- Server console logs lacked timestamps
- Difficult to track the sequence and timing of API requests

### Fixes
- Added ISO timestamps to all server console logs
- Included timestamps for requests, responses, and errors
- Improved log format for better readability

### Implementation Details
- Updated `server-console-logger.ts` to include timestamps
- Added unique request IDs for tracking requests through the system
- Improved error logging with timestamps

## 3. Fixing Log File Issues

### Issues
- Log files were not being created properly
- No feedback when logs were written
- Error handling for log file creation was insufficient

### Fixes
- Added proper log directory and file creation
- Improved error handling for log file operations
- Added console feedback when logs are written

### Implementation Details
- Updated `server-logger.ts` to create log directory and file if they don't exist
- Added retry logic for log file creation
- Added console feedback when logs are written (in development mode)

## 4. Fixing OCR Results Issues

### Issues
- OCR results were not being saved properly
- Column name mismatch between code and database
- Camel case vs. snake case property naming issues

### Fixes
- Fixed column name mapping for OCR results
- Properly handled camel case to snake case conversion
- Improved error handling for OCR results saving

### Implementation Details
- Updated `results-service.ts` to properly map properties
- Extracted camel case properties and converted to snake case
- Ensured document_id is properly set from the parameter value

## Next Steps

1. **Testing**: Test the file upload and processing flow to ensure that files are properly uploaded, processed, and results are saved.

2. **Monitoring**: Monitor the application logs for any remaining errors related to file processing.

3. **Error Handling**: Enhance error handling for edge cases, such as when a document record can't be found.

4. **User Experience**: Improve user feedback during file uploads and processing.

5. **Performance**: Consider optimizing the logging system to reduce overhead in production.
