# Final Direct Logging Production Update

## Overview
This update takes a more direct approach to controlling logs in production environments by using explicit environment checks instead of relying on utility functions.

## Changes Made

### 1. Simplified the Approach in lib/log.ts
- Added direct environment detection: `const isProduction = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'`
- Created a whitelist of allowed production logs
- Simplified the `middlewareLog` function to be more direct

### 2. Direct Environment Checks in middleware.ts
- Replaced all utility function calls with direct environment checks:
  ```typescript
  // Only log in development
  if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') {
    console.log('Middleware: Created Supabase client with URL:', process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL)
  }
  ```
- Only two logs are allowed in production (without any conditions):
  ```typescript
  // Always log the request URL in all environments
  console.log('Middleware: Processing request for URL:', req.nextUrl.pathname)
  
  // Always log route checks in all environments
  console.log('Middleware: Route check -', {
    url,
    isProtectedRoute,
    isAuthRoute,
    isAuthenticated: !!session
  })
  ```

### 3. Direct Environment Checks in server-auth.ts
- Replaced all utility function calls with direct environment checks:
  ```typescript
  // Only log in development
  if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') {
    console.log('Server-Auth: Found cookies:', allCookies.map(c => c.name))
  }
  ```

## Key Benefits
- More direct and reliable approach to controlling logs
- No dependency on utility functions that might have issues
- Explicit environment checks at each log point
- Guaranteed to only show the two specified logs in production

## Production Logs Now Limited To Only
- Request processing information: `Middleware: Processing request for URL: /auth/login`
- Route check information:
  ```
  Middleware: Route check - {
    url: '/auth/login',
    isProtectedRoute: false,
    isAuthRoute: true,
    isAuthenticated: false
  }
  ```

All other logs are now completely eliminated in production environments through direct environment checks.
