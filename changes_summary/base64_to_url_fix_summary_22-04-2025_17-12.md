# Base64 to Signed URL Fix Summary
**Date: 16-05-2024 17:12**

## Issue

The application was storing images as base64 data in the database despite uploading them to Supabase storage. This caused:

1. Database bloat due to storing large base64 strings
2. Performance issues when loading images
3. Redundant storage of the same data

## Root Cause

The issue was in the `file-processor.ts` file. While the application was correctly uploading files to Supabase storage and generating signed URLs, it was not consistently using these URLs in the OCR results. In some cases, the base64 data was still being stored in the `imageUrl` field of the OCR results.

## Changes Made

1. **Updated `file-processor.ts`**:
   - Added explicit comments to use signed URLs instead of base64 data
   - Added logging to track the generation of signed URLs
   - Ensured all image processing paths use the signed URL

2. **Created Migration Script**:
   - Created a new script `scripts/migrate-base64-to-signed-url.ts` to:
     - Find all OCR results with base64 image URLs
     - Upload the base64 data to Supabase storage if not already uploaded
     - Generate signed URLs for the uploaded files
     - Update the database records with the signed URLs and storage paths

## How to Run the Migration

To convert existing base64 data to signed URLs, run the migration script:

```bash
npx ts-node scripts/migrate-base64-to-signed-url.ts
```

This will:
1. Find all OCR results with base64 image URLs
2. Upload the images to Supabase storage
3. Generate signed URLs
4. Update the database records

## Benefits

1. **Reduced Database Size**: Storing URLs instead of base64 data significantly reduces database size
2. **Improved Performance**: Loading URLs is faster than loading large base64 strings
3. **Reduced Bandwidth Usage**: Transferring URLs uses less bandwidth than transferring base64 data
4. **Lower Memory Usage**: Processing URLs requires less memory than processing base64 strings
5. **Single Source of Truth**: Images are stored only once in Supabase storage
6. **Enhanced Security**: Signed URLs provide better security than public URLs

## Verification

After running the migration script, you can verify the changes by:

1. Checking the database to ensure no OCR results have base64 image URLs
2. Uploading new documents and verifying they use signed URLs
3. Viewing documents in the UI to ensure images load correctly

## Next Steps

1. Monitor the application to ensure all new uploads use signed URLs
2. Consider adding a periodic job to refresh expired signed URLs
3. Update any other parts of the application that might still be using base64 data
