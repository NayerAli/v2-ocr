# Logging Refactor Summary

## Overview
This refactor focused on improving the logging system in the application to reduce console noise, make logs environment-aware, and ensure a consistent approach to logging across the codebase.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created a Centralized Logging Utility
- Created `lib/log.ts` with the following functions:
  - `debugLog`: For development-only debugging logs
  - `debugError`: For development and test errors
  - `infoLog`: For informational messages
  - `warnLog`: For warnings
  - `prodLog`: For critical logs that must always be shown
  - `serverLog`: For server-side logs with timestamps and request IDs
  - `serverError`: For server-side error logs with timestamps and request IDs
  - `shouldLog`: Helper function to reduce log frequency

### 2. Refactored Server-Side Logging
- Updated `lib/server-console-logger.ts` to use the new logging utility
- Updated `lib/server-logger.ts` to use the new logging utility
- Updated `app/api/utils.ts` to use the new logging utility
- Updated `middleware.ts` to use the new logging utility
- Updated `lib/auth.ts` to use the new logging utility
- Updated `app/auth/callback/route.ts` to use the new logging utility

### 3. Refactored Client-Side Logging
- Updated `app/page.tsx` to use the new logging utility
- Updated `hooks/use-settings-init.ts` to use the new logging utility
- Updated `lib/database/utils/config.ts` to use the new logging utility
- Updated `components/auth/auth-provider.tsx` to use the new logging utility
- Updated `components/auth/auth-check.tsx` to use the new logging utility

### 4. Key Benefits
- Logs are now environment-aware, with most debug logs only showing in development
- Reduced console noise in production builds
- Consistent logging format across the application
- Improved server-side logging with timestamps and request IDs
- Better control over log verbosity

## Testing
The application was tested to ensure it starts correctly with the new logging system in place.

## Next Steps
- Continue refactoring any remaining console.log statements in the codebase
- Consider adding more structured logging for production environments
- Add log rotation for file-based logs
- Consider integrating with a logging service for production environments
