# Async Processing Service Fix - 20-05-2024

## Issue Description
After implementing the API key update fix, a new issue was introduced where the `processingService.addToQueue` function was not available. This was due to the `getProcessingService` function being changed to be asynchronous, but the code in `app/page.tsx` was still using it in a synchronous way with `useMemo`.

## Root Cause
The `getProcessingService` function was modified to be asynchronous to ensure it always gets the latest API key, but the component that uses this service was not updated to handle the asynchronous nature of the function.

## Implemented Fixes

### 1. Changed Component to Use Async Processing Service
- Replaced `useMemo` with `useRef` and `useEffect` to properly handle the asynchronous initialization of the processing service
- Added proper error handling for cases where the service is not yet initialized
- Updated all functions that use the processing service to check if it's initialized before using it

### 2. Improved Error Handling
- Added checks to ensure the processing service is initialized before attempting to use it
- Added user-friendly error messages when the service is not available
- Ensured all async operations have proper error handling

### 3. Code Cleanup
- Removed unnecessary code and improved code organization
- Added better comments to explain the async initialization process

## Files Modified
1. `app/page.tsx` - Updated to handle the asynchronous processing service

## Testing
The changes have been tested to ensure:
1. The processing service is properly initialized asynchronously
2. All functions that use the processing service check if it's initialized
3. Proper error messages are shown when the service is not available

## Next Steps
1. Monitor the application to ensure the fix resolves the issue with the processing service
2. Consider implementing a more robust state management system for asynchronous services
3. Add more comprehensive error handling for asynchronous operations
