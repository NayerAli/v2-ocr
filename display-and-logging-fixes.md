# Display and Logging Fixes

## 1. Fixing the File Display Issue

### Issue
- Processed files were not being displayed on the dashboard or document list page
- The `getQueue` function was only retrieving documents with status 'pending', 'processing', or 'queued', but not 'completed' documents

### Fix
- Updated the `getQueue` function in `queue-service.ts` to include all statuses, including 'completed', 'failed', and 'cancelled'
- This ensures that all documents, regardless of their status, are retrieved and displayed in the UI

### Implementation Details
```typescript
// If user is authenticated, filter by user_id
if (user) {
  query = query
    .eq('user_id', user.id)
    // Include all statuses including 'completed'
    .in('status', ['pending', 'processing', 'queued', 'completed', 'failed', 'cancelled'])
} else {
  // For backward compatibility, still filter by status
  query = query.in('status', ['pending', 'processing', 'queued', 'completed', 'failed', 'cancelled'])
}
```

## 2. Reducing Browser Console Logs

### Issue
- Browser console was being spammed with debug logs
- Logs were being printed on every render, even when not needed
- Queue service and database service were particularly verbose

### Fixes
- Added conditional logging based on development environment
- Reduced frequency of logs using random sampling
- Only log on initial load or significant state changes
- Added proper conditions to prevent excessive logging

### Implementation Details

#### Queue Service
```typescript
// Only log in development mode and not too frequently
const shouldLog = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' && Math.random() < 0.05;

if (shouldLog) {
  console.log('[DEBUG] supabase-db.getQueue called');
}
```

#### Database Service
```typescript
// Only log in development mode and not too frequently
const shouldLog = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' && Math.random() < 0.1;

if (shouldLog) {
  console.log('[DEBUG] Updating local cache');
}
```

## Next Steps

1. **Testing**: Test the file upload and processing flow to ensure that files are properly uploaded, processed, and displayed in the UI.

2. **Monitoring**: Monitor the application logs for any remaining excessive logging.

3. **User Experience**: Ensure that the UI properly displays all documents, including completed ones.

4. **Performance**: Consider further optimizing the logging system to reduce overhead in production.

5. **Error Handling**: Enhance error handling for edge cases, such as when a document record can't be found.
