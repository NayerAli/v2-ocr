# Error Document Display Fix (Part 2) - 15-04-2025 17:20

## Issue Description
Documents with error status were not being displayed in the document list or dashboard, even though they were correctly marked with error status in the database. This made it impossible for users to see, manage, or retry failed documents.

## Root Causes
1. The queue service was not including "error" status in the list of statuses to fetch from the database
2. The getStatusIcon and getStatusBadgeClass functions in the document list component were not properly handling "failed" status

## Implemented Fixes

### 1. Updated Queue Service Status Filtering
- Added "error" status to the list of statuses to fetch from the database
- Added detailed logging of status distribution to help diagnose issues
- Ensured that all document statuses are properly included in database queries

### 2. Enhanced Document List Component
- Updated the getStatusIcon function to handle "failed" status
- Updated the getStatusBadgeClass function to apply the same styling to "error" and "failed" statuses
- Added fallback icon and debug logging for unknown statuses

## Files Modified
1. `lib/database/services/queue-service.ts` - Updated status filtering and added detailed logging
2. `app/components/document-list.tsx` - Enhanced status icon and badge handling

## Testing
The changes have been tested to ensure:
1. Documents with error status are properly displayed in the document list and dashboard
2. The status icons and badges are correctly displayed for all document statuses
3. The retry functionality works correctly for documents with error status

## Next Steps
1. Monitor the application to ensure the fix resolves the issue with error document display
2. Consider adding more detailed error information for failed documents
3. Add more comprehensive logging for document status changes
