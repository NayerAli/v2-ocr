# Document API Authentication Fix - 15-04-2025 17:48

## Issue Description
The document API endpoint (`/api/documents/[id]`) was returning 401 Unauthorized errors when trying to retry documents. This was happening because the API endpoint was using the `getUser()` function from `@/lib/auth`, which was not working correctly in the API route context.

## Root Causes
1. The `getUser()` function from `@/lib/auth` was not properly handling authentication in the API route context
2. The API endpoint was not using the same authentication method as other working API endpoints
3. The middleware was correctly identifying the user, but the API endpoint couldn't access the user information

## Implemented Fixes

### 1. Updated Authentication Method
- Replaced the `getUser()` function with the server-side authentication method used in other API endpoints
- Added `createServerSupabaseClient()` from `@/lib/server-auth` to create a Supabase client with the correct authentication context
- Implemented the same cookie parsing and token extraction logic used in other API endpoints

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling
- Added detailed error logging for authentication failures
- Improved error messages to help diagnose authentication issues
- Added fallback authentication methods to handle different authentication scenarios

### 3. Consistent Authentication Across Endpoints
- Ensured all API endpoints use the same authentication method
- Made the document API endpoint consistent with the settings API endpoint
- Maintained the same security level and authentication flow across all endpoints

## Files Modified
1. `app/api/documents/[id]/route.ts` - Updated authentication method for GET, PUT, and DELETE endpoints

## Testing
The changes have been tested to ensure:
1. The document API endpoint properly authenticates users
2. The retry functionality works correctly without 401 errors
3. The authentication is consistent with other API endpoints

## Next Steps
1. Monitor the application to ensure the fix resolves the authentication issues
2. Consider refactoring the authentication logic into a shared utility function to avoid duplication
3. Add more comprehensive error handling for API endpoints
