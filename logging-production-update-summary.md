# Logging Production Update Summary

## Overview
This update focused on improving the logging system to reduce unnecessary logs in production environments, particularly for cookie-related information in middleware and authentication processes.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Logging Utility
- Added a new `middlewareLog` function to `lib/log.ts` that conditionally logs based on environment and importance:
  ```typescript
  export function middlewareLog(type: 'important' | 'debug', message: string, ...args: unknown[]) {
    if (type === 'important' || process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') {
      console.log(message, ...args)
    }
  }
  ```

### 2. Updated Middleware Logging
- Modified `middleware.ts` to use the new `middlewareLog` function
- Categorized logs as either 'important' or 'debug':
  - Important logs (shown in all environments):
    - Request URL processing
    - Route check information (URL, protection status, authentication status)
  - Debug logs (only shown in development):
    - Cookie parsing details
    - Authentication token details
    - Session verification details

### 3. Updated Server-Side Auth Logging
- Modified `lib/server-auth.ts` to use the new logging approach
- Categorized all cookie-related logs as 'debug' to prevent them from showing in production
- Maintained error logs for critical issues using `debugError`

## Key Benefits
- Significantly reduced console noise in production environments
- Sensitive cookie information is no longer logged in production
- Important logs for request tracking and debugging are still available
- Maintained detailed logging in development for debugging purposes

## Testing
The application was tested to ensure it starts correctly with the new logging system in place.

## Production Logs Now Limited To
- Request processing information: `Middleware: Processing request for URL: /auth/login`
- Route check information:
  ```
  Middleware: Route check - {
    url: '/auth/login',
    isProtectedRoute: false,
    isAuthRoute: true,
    isAuthenticated: false
  }
  ```

All cookie-related logs and detailed authentication process logs are now only shown in development environments.
