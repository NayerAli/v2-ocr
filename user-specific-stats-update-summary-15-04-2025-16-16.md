# User-Specific Statistics Update Summary (15-04-2025 16:16)

## Overview
This update modifies the database statistics functionality to be user-specific, ensuring that each user only sees their own storage usage and can only access their own documents.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created User-Specific SQL Functions
- Added `get_user_file_size(user_id)` function to calculate total file size for a specific user
- Added `get_current_user_file_size()` function to calculate total file size for the current authenticated user
- Added `get_user_ocr_size(user_id)` function to calculate total OCR text size for a specific user
- Added `get_current_user_ocr_size()` function to calculate total OCR text size for the current authenticated user

### 2. Updated `getDatabaseStats` Function
- Modified to only count documents belonging to the current user
- Modified to only count OCR results belonging to the current user
- Updated to use the new user-specific SQL functions
- Added fallback mechanisms that respect user isolation

### 3. Updated Database Management Functions
- Modified `clearDatabase()` to only clear the current user's data
- Modified `cleanupOldRecords()` to only clean up the current user's old records
- Added user authentication checks to prevent operations when no user is authenticated

## Technical Details

### SQL Functions
The new SQL functions ensure data isolation at the database level:

1. **get_user_file_size(user_id)**
   ```sql
   CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.get_user_file_size(user_id uuid)
   RETURNS bigint
   LANGUAGE sql
   SECURITY DEFINER
   AS $$
     SELECT COALESCE(SUM(file_size), 0)::bigint
     FROM public.documents
     WHERE documents.user_id = get_user_file_size.user_id;
   $$;
   ```

2. **get_current_user_file_size()**
   ```sql
   CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.get_current_user_file_size()
   RETURNS bigint
   LANGUAGE sql
   SECURITY INVOKER
   AS $$
     SELECT public.get_user_file_size(auth.uid());
   $$;
   ```

Similar functions were created for OCR size calculations.

### JavaScript Implementation
The updated functions now:
1. Get the current user's ID using `supabase.auth.getUser()`
2. Filter all database queries by `user_id` to ensure data isolation
3. Use the new SQL functions that automatically filter by the current user
4. Include fallback mechanisms that also respect user isolation

## Benefits
- **Data Isolation**: Each user only sees their own storage usage and documents
- **Security**: Prevents unauthorized access to other users' data
- **Accuracy**: Storage statistics accurately reflect each user's actual usage
- **Scalability**: Better performance by only processing relevant user data
