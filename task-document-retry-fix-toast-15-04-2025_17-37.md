# Document Retry Fix (Toast Fix) - 15-04-2025 17:37

## Issue Description
After implementing the document retry functionality, there was an error in the documents page: `ReferenceError: toast is not defined`. This was causing the documents page to crash with a 500 error.

## Root Causes
1. The `useToast` hook was not imported in the documents page
2. The `toast` function was being used without being properly initialized

## Implemented Fixes

### 1. Added Missing Import
- Added `import { useToast } from "@/components/ui/use-toast"` to the documents page

### 2. Initialized Toast Hook
- Added `const { toast } = useToast()` to the DocumentsPage component
- Ensured the toast function is properly available in the component scope

## Files Modified
1. `app/documents/page.tsx` - Added useToast import and initialization

## Testing
The changes have been tested to ensure:
1. The documents page loads without errors
2. The retry functionality works correctly with proper toast notifications
3. No more 500 errors when accessing the documents page

## Next Steps
1. Monitor the application to ensure the fix resolves the issue with toast notifications
2. Consider adding more comprehensive error handling for all API calls
