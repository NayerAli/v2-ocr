# Document Retry Fix (Import Fix) - 15-04-2025 17:40

## Issue Description
After adding the useToast hook to the documents page, there was a build error: `Module not found: Can't resolve '@/components/ui/use-toast'`. This was causing the documents page to crash with a 500 error.

## Root Causes
1. The import path for the useToast hook was incorrect
2. The hook is actually located in `@/hooks/use-toast`, not `@/components/ui/use-toast`

## Implemented Fixes

### 1. Corrected Import Path
- Changed `import { useToast } from "@/components/ui/use-toast"` to `import { useToast } from "@/hooks/use-toast"`
- Ensured the import path matches the actual location of the hook in the codebase

## Files Modified
1. `app/documents/page.tsx` - Corrected the useToast import path

## Testing
The changes have been tested to ensure:
1. The documents page builds without errors
2. The retry functionality works correctly with proper toast notifications
3. No more 500 errors when accessing the documents page

## Next Steps
1. Monitor the application to ensure the fix resolves the issue with toast notifications
2. Consider adding more comprehensive error handling for all API calls
